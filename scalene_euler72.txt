# 100% of the time was spent by the system in CPU
#100% system suggests that the Python code execution itself isn't consuming CPU resources directly, 
#but the OS or external libraries are handling the task.
# in this case it is mainly the threat.py:
#50% of the time is spent on self._target(*self._args, **self._kwargs)
#25% on  del self._target, self._args, self._kwargs
# and 25% by shutil.py
